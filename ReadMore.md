- First, do the homework and discuss it on our [community forums](https://discourse.univ.ai). Feel free to ask any and all questions there.
- If you would like to learn all aspects of Classification (and some math and stats) needed to do AI, our [AI-1](https://welcome.univ.ai/courses/ai1/) course is great!
