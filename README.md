# Classificationworkshop
Whether the problems exist as classification or not, they do get often converted to classification problems. 
We will first look at some of the easier and straightforward examples for classification. 
We’ll start with simple models and work up to more complex ones. 
Then we go depth into one of the binary class use-cases along with a dataset. 
We will solve it and spend some time discussing metrics and measurements.

At the end of this workshop you will enhance your repertoire from understanding regression to being able to use a variety of models in classification problems. Additionally you’ll understand which metrics to use to evaluate the performance of your models.
